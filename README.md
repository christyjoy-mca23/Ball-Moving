 This HTML and JavaScript code create a simple bouncing ball animation within a specified area. The ball moves back and forth horizontally and vertically, bouncing off the boundaries.

**Description:**

- The HTML file contains a `div` element representing the ball, styled with CSS to give it a red color and a circular shape.
- The JavaScript code controls the ball's movement within the defined X and Y boundaries, changing direction when it reaches those boundaries.

**Future improvements:**

1. **Responsive Design:**
   Make the animation responsive by adjusting the boundaries (`Xmax`, `Ymax`) based on the device's dimensions or using CSS media queries.

2. **Enhanced User Interaction:**
   Add event listeners to allow user interaction, such as starting, pausing, or resetting the animation.

3. **Code Refactoring:**
   Organize the code into functions, use meaningful variable names, and add comments for better readability and maintainability.

**To run the code:**

1. **Create an HTML file:**
   Create a new file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`) and copy the provided HTML and JavaScript code into this file.

2. **Open the HTML file in a web browser:**
   Double-click the HTML file to open it in your default web browser or right-click and choose a specific browser to open the file.

3. **View the animation:**
   The ball will move within the specified X and Y boundaries, bouncing back when it reaches the edges. The setInterval function controls the animation, updating the ball's position every 500 milliseconds (as specified in `setInterval(moveBall, 500);`).
